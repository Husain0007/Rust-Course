* Ownership is a Rust alternative to **Garbage Collection** in languages like C# & Java, i.e.; it is a form of memory management.

|Memory Management Techniques | Pros  | Cons|
|--|:--:|--:|
|Garbage Collection  |  Error Free + Faster to Write |  No Control Over Memory + Slower/ Unpredictable Runtime Performance + Larger Program Size  |
|Manual Memory Management    |  Control Over Memory + Faster Runtime + Smaller Program Size | Error prone + Slower write time    |
| **Ownership Model** | Control Over Memory + Error free + Faster runtime + Smaller program size   | Slower write time + Learning curve |
